# Ideas For Future Games

## Real-Time Avatar Transformation
* Projector: Shows player as a transformed avatar (robot, dragon)
* Kinect: Captures skeleton & overlays effects
* Mechanic: Powers activate based on movement:
  * Raise arms = wings open
  * Jump = fire shockwave
  * Turn = body transforms

## Floor Is Lava — Physical Dodge Game
* Projector: Lava flowing on the floor
* Kinect: Tracks feet positions
* Mechanic: Lava “flares” erupt; players must move to safe zones.
* Why it works: No hand tracking required, easy mapping to floor space.

## Object Catcher / Fruit Drop
Projected fruits or items fall from the top of the TV.
* Catch with hands or head
* Red items you must avoid
* Combos for catching multiple items at once
* Super easy to implement, surprisingly addictive

## Pose Master
A Simon Says / Just Dance hybrid.
* Game flashes a pose silhouette
* You match it quickly
* Increasing speed and difficulty
* Add funny poses for comedy value
